1. Switch is faster than if/else because of jump tree.
2. Beginning with JDK 7, expression can also be of type String.
        But we should not use it unnecessarily.
3. Switching on string can be more expensive than switching on integers.
4. Nested Switch is possible.
7. If/else can evaluate any type of Boolean expression.
        That is, the switch looks only for a match between the value
        of the expression and one of its case constants.
8. using break statement is optional.
